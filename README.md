This little boy here tries to find if there is any relationship between
the GDP of a country in 2020 and the price of Netflix subscriptions in said country.

Mainly made for me to learn the different python libraries.
Mainly uses pandas for data manipulation and seaborn for making figures.

It cleans the table of the data I have, and makes a final dataframe that includes the data to be visualized.
Then it makes scatterplots of the data, and heatmaps for the correlation matrix using Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlations.
